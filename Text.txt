Presently, datas are checked or authenticated by comparing the inputs with the value already stored in the codebase.
The code keeps running until you exit.
The create_account section just basically collects user's data, get it stored as a dictionary. The datas are not being used for now though,
but the template is there for later upgrade. Account number is randomly generated.
The authentication section is yet to be implemented. I think it will require a database kindaa.

Instruction:
 Open Account: While creating account, validate inputs, number instead of strings should be intercepted, date of birth must have date format, email must have @.
 Automatic date and time account created ms tbe displayed. Three times should lead to blockage of account.
 After creating account, all records should stored in a file. When another user tries to create, same name should not be tolerated
